# KEDA Project Guidelines & Rules

You are an expert developer working on the KEDA project. Follow these guidelines strictly to ensure consistency and quality.

## 🌟 General Principles
- **Aesthetics First**: Follow `STYLE_GUIDE.md` for all UI changes. The goal is a premium, "data-driven minimalism" feel.
- **Proactivity**: Suggest improvements and follow-up tasks (e.g., updating docs, adding tests) but ask for clarification if a design decision is ambiguous.
- **Automation**: Use `Makefile` targets whenever possible (`make lint`, `make test`, `make generate-assets`).

## 📱 Flutter (Client)
- **Architecture**: Composition > Inheritance. Keep widgets focused.
- **Testing**: ONLY use `getByRole` with explicit names. If an element lacks a clear text for filtering, you MUST add it to the code.
- **Android Integration**: Use `--dart-define` flags as specified in `Makefile` and `scripts/ensure_emulator.sh`.

## 🚀 Go (Server)
- **Style**: Standard Go idioms. Use `golangci-lint` for verification.
- **Testing**: Include unit tests with coverage for new features.

## 🎭 Playwright (Preview & Assets)
- **Reliability**: Avoid `toBeVisible()` for elements that might take time to render. Use `waitFor()` or specific timeouts if necessary.
- **Selectors**: USE ONLY `page.getByRole()`. 
    - *Exception*: You MAY use `page.getByLabel('LabelName').first()` specifically for main navigation tabs (e.g., 'Accounts', 'Settings', 'Home'). 
    - If an element lacks a role or clear text, you MUST modify the code to add it. Do not use other selectors unless it is via `getByRole`.
- **Assets**: Scripts for generating screenshots and videos are in `preview-generator/`. Follow the naming pattern: `[action]-[feature].png`.
- **Spotlight**: Use the spotlight feature for highlighting UI elements in documentation screenshots.

## 🎨 UI/UX (from STYLE_GUIDE.md)
- **Primary Color**: #22C55E (Success)
- **Warning Color**: #FACC15 (Low budget < 30%)
- **Danger Color**: #EF4444 (Over-budget)
- **Typography**: 'Inter' or 'Roboto' for UI, 'JetBrains Mono' for numbers.
- **Zero Friction**: The "Remaining" amount is the focal point. Use non-accounting terms ("Left", "Remaining").

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `/server`: Go backend.
- `/landing`: Vanilla HTML/JS landing page.
- `/docs`: Documentation (VitePress).
- `/preview-generator`: Playwright tests for generating assets.
- `/scripts`: Shell scripts for CI/CD and local setup.
