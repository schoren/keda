# Install on iOS

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

Since KEDA is not yet available on the App Store, you can install it as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your iPhone or iPad for a native-like experience.

## Steps to Install

1.  **Open Safari**: Navigate to [https://app.getkeda.app](https://app.getkeda.app) (or your self-hosted instance).
2.  **Tap Share**: Tap the **Share** button (the square with an upwards arrow) at the bottom of the screen.
3.  **Add to Home Screen**: Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**.
4.  **Confirm**: Tap **Add** in the top-right corner.

The KEDA icon will now appear on your home screen, and you can open it just like any other app!
