# Install on Android

## Direct Download (APK)

Since KEDA is not yet available on the Google Play Store, you can download and install the application directly using the Android Package (APK) file.

## Steps to Install

1.  **Download the APK**: Visit the [KEDA Releases](https://github.com/schoren/keda/releases) page on your Android device and download the latest `keda_android_vX.Y.Z.apk`.
2.  **Open the File**: Once the download is complete, tap on the file in your notification bar or your "Downloads" folder.
3.  **Allow Unknown Apps**: If prompted, allow your browser or file manager to "Install unknown apps". This is a standard Android security feature for apps not downloaded from the Play Store.
4.  **Confirm Installation**: Tap **Install** and wait for the process to finish.
5.  **Open KEDA**: Tap **Open** or find the KEDA icon in your app drawer.


> [!NOTE]
> You may need to repeat this process for future updates, as the app does not currently support automatic updates when installed via APK.
