# Budget Recommendations

Keda helps you optimize your family budget by analyzing your previous month's spending and suggesting adjustments.

## How it works

During the first 14 days of each month, Keda evaluates how much you spent in each category compared to your planned budget for the previous month.

If your spending in a category was significantly higher or lower (more than 10% difference), Keda will suggest an adjustment for the current month.

### 1. The Suggestion Alert

When recommendations are available, a notification will appear on your dashboard.

### 2. Reviewing Suggestions

Click on **View Suggestions** to see the detailed recommendations. For each category, Keda will propose:
- **Increase**: if you spent more than planned, suggesting a more realistic budget.
- **Decrease**: if you spent less than planned, helping you save or reallocate funds.

### 3. Applying Changes

In the review dialog, you can see how the proposed changes affect your **Total Monthly Budget**.
- Select the suggestions you want to follow.
- Click **Apply Selected** to automatically update your category budgets.

> [!TIP]
> You can dismiss the notification if you're not ready to review the suggestions yet. It will reappear until the 14th of the month or until you apply the changes.
