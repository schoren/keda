# Keda

A simple application to manage Keda finances, allowing expense tracking by categories and collaboration between household members.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started (Docker Compose)

The fastest way to run the project is using Docker Compose. This will spin up both the server and the client, as well as a PostgreSQL database and a mail server for testing (Mailpit).

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

First, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, edit the `.env` file with your settings. It is important to configure at least the `JWT_SECRET` and Google credentials if you wish to use Google authentication.

### 2. Run with Docker Compose

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 3. Access the Application

Once the containers are running:

- **Frontend (Web):** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Backend (API):** [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)
- **Mailpit (Mail Interface):** [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage with automated test runners via Makefile:

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration + E2E)
make test

# Run specific test suites
make test-backend    # Go unit tests (87% coverage)
make test-client     # Flutter unit tests (57% coverage)
make test-e2e        # End-to-end integration tests

# Quick tests (skip E2E)
make test-quick

# View all available commands
make help
```

## Local Development

If you prefer to run the services independently for development:

### Backend
The server is developed in Go. You can find more details in the `/server` directory.

### Frontend
The client is a Flutter application. You can find more details in the `/client` directory.
